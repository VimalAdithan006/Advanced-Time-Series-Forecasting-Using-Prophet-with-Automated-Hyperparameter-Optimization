----Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Prophet and Hyperparameter Optimization----

Time series forecasting plays a critical role in data-driven decision-making, particularly in domains such as energy consumption, e-commerce demand planning, transportation analytics, and financial market monitoring. This project explores advanced forecasting methodologies using Meta’s Prophet model while emphasizing the integration of systematic hyperparameter optimization strategies. To evaluate model performance and examine the effects of tuning key parameters, a highly realistic synthetic dataset was programmatically constructed. The experiment provides insight into Prophet’s strengths, limitations, and sensitivities when applied to complex, multi-seasonal data.

The foundation of this project lies in the generation of a synthetic dataset spanning more than three years of hourly observations (approximately 26,000 data points). This dataset was designed to closely replicate real-world temporal structures by incorporating multiple seasonal patterns, including daily (24-hour), weekly, and yearly cycles. These seasonalities reflect known behavioral rhythms, such as weekday/weekend dynamics or temperature-driven annual fluctuations. Additionally, trend shifts were injected into the data via programmed changepoints, simulating abrupt structural changes often observed in business processes—for example, operational adjustments, market shocks, or long-term demand transitions. To enhance realism, heteroscedastic noise and isolated outliers were added, along with synthetic holiday effects represented as temporary spikes or dips around predefined festival dates. Together, these elements provided a robust and challenging environment for evaluating the Prophet model.

Prophet decomposes a time series into trend, seasonality, and holiday components using an additive model. The model is particularly well-suited for business-oriented time series due to its flexibility and interpretability. However, the accuracy of Prophet is highly dependent on three core hyperparameters: **`changepoint_prior_scale`**, **`seasonality_prior_scale`**, and **`holidays_prior_scale`**. These parameters govern the model’s responsiveness to structural changes, seasonal patterns, and holiday effects respectively. Incorrect or default parameter values may lead to underfitting (overly smooth forecasts) or overfitting (excessive sensitivity to noise). Therefore, a systematic hyperparameter optimization approach is necessary to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy.

The project adopted a Grid Search strategy combined with rolling-origin validation, which is well aligned with the temporal nature of forecasting tasks. Rolling-origin validation avoids information leakage by training models on progressively expanding windows of historical data and validating performance on forward-held segments. The grid search explored combinations of three hyperparameters across reasonable candidate ranges: changepoint_prior_scale values of {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5}, seasonality_prior_scale values of {1, 5, 10}, and holidays_prior_scale values of {1, 5, 10}. For each combination, the root mean squared error (RMSE) on validation splits was averaged to select the optimal setting. This procedure enabled the identification of parameter sets that allowed Prophet to balance flexibility and generalization effectively.

Before optimization, a baseline Prophet model was trained using standard seasonalities and default hyperparameters. While the baseline successfully captured general periodic patterns, its trend component lacked sufficient flexibility to respond to abrupt shifts introduced in the synthetic dataset. This limitation was reflected in its performance metrics: the baseline exhibited moderate RMSE and MAPE values, and visual inspection showed delayed adaptation to regime changes.

Hyperparameter tuning produced significant improvements. Lower values of changepoint_prior_scale allowed the model to adjust more sensitively to trend breaks without becoming overly reactive to noise. Meanwhile, tuning seasonality_prior_scale helped balance the strength of periodic components—critical in a dataset containing multiple overlapping seasonalities. Adjusting holidays_prior_scale ensured that holiday effects were neither over-amplified nor overly smoothed. The best-performing parameter combination resulted in lower MAE, RMSE, and MAPE values across the test set, demonstrating the value of structured hyperparameter exploration.

After identifying optimal hyperparameters, the Prophet model was retrained on the full training set and evaluated against the held-out final 20% of the dataset. The optimized model achieved substantial accuracy gains relative to the baseline approach. The forecast more successfully aligned with fluctuations caused by trend shifts and periodic variations. Component plots revealed distinct daily, weekly, and yearly seasonalities, confirming that Prophet effectively decomposed the synthetic time series into interpretable structures.

The project underscores several key insights. First, Prophet is highly effective for time series exhibiting complex seasonalities, provided that appropriate hyperparameters are selected. Second, synthetic datasets with controlled patterns are valuable tools for understanding model behavior in a structured setting. Third, hyperparameter optimization—particularly using rolling-origin validation—provides a principled way to prevent both underfitting and overfitting. Finally, interpretability remains one of Prophet’s primary strengths: component plots assist in diagnosing model behavior and connecting statistical patterns to domain knowledge.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates a complete and rigorous approach to advanced forecasting using Prophet. By constructing a realistic synthetic dataset, applying a systematic hyperparameter optimization pipeline, and thoroughly evaluating performance metrics, the analysis offers both theoretical understanding and practical guidance. The improved forecast accuracy achieved through tuning highlights the importance of careful modeling decisions, especially in real-world environments where data patterns are dynamic and multi-seasonal.
